                        I have been working at CourtsYard & Greenhouse from 2018-present.
                        At this greenhouse, most of the time I am organizing plants and 
                        paying close attention to detail to ensure the healthiness of the product.
                        Oftentimes I will communicate with customers to ensure they are finding things
                        easily and ensuring their experience at the greenhouse is satisfactory.
                        In this job, communication and independency is critical, as the greenhouse is 
                        often so busy that it is imperitive that you are able to use problem-solving skills.

                    <p> I worked at Adrian Orchards from 2018-2022. At Adrian Orchards, 
                        I was tasked with maintaining the stock of the store, and ensuring
                         there was enough product for each day. By checking in constantly 
                         and refilling stock, I helped the Orchard stay prepared for all of
                          the customers coming to buy apples and other products. I continued
                           to work here for several years seasonally, as during the fall the orchards tended to be busier than the rest of the year, until the eventual selling
                            of the property.

                    <p> I have been babysitting several kids from the years of 2018-present. 
                        I have babysat for several families and adjusted my methods depending
                         on each parent’s ideals. Most of the time, I am babysitting young kids.
                          Most recently I have been watching two twin three month olds. In this 
                          job, communication with the parents is incredibly important, and being 
                          able to adapt to different situations is as well.</p>
