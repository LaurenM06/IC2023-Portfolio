                        Currently, I am attending Perry Meridian High school. 
                        This school provides me with a wide range of opportunities, 
                        such as clubs and different graduation pathways. This school
                         is incredibly diverse, allowing me to interact with a lot of 
                         different people and cultures, and preparing me for the real 
                         world. Not only are the extracurriculars at this school numerous,
                          but they each add a different perspective to my academic life,
                           as well as allow me to gain networking and other usable life 
                           skills. The teachers at this school are incredibly helpful and
                            there is always at least one teacher that is willing to assist
                             me if I have any questions about any given topic. I make it a
                              point to put my academics first, maintaining above a 4.2 GPA,
                               and making sure to challenge myself in my classes.

                        <p class="schoolingContent">At Perry Meridian High School there is an optional Early College 
                        pathway that allows students to take dual credit courses and secure
                         college credits to prepare them for college. In this program 
                         there is an option to take enough dual-credit courses to award
                          you an associates degree, which is the track I am currently taking. 
                          This is incredibly useful to those planning on obtaining a bachelor's 
                          degree, as many of the credits are applicable to general education
                           classes a majority of majors will require you to take your freshman 
                           year. This is an incredible opportunity to save money, challenge
                            yourself, and possibly save time in college by applying those credits.

                    <h3 class="schoolingHeader"> AP Courses</h3>
                    <p class="schoolingContent">Perry Meridian High School has an assortment of AP classes available to 
                        its students, as I am taking a majority of dual credit courses, there
                         isn’t much room in my schedule for AP courses. However, I do try to 
                         challenge myself when it comes to academics, so I am taking AP courses 
                         alongside the dual-credit track. Through my high school career, I will
                          have taken 4 AP classes, focused in STEM. These classes include: AP
                           Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Physics1, and AP Computer Science.</p>
