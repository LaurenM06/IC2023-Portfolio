                <div class="volunteeringContent">
                    <p class="volPara"> Girls Inc is a volunteering experience through Cyber Blue. 
                        In this volunteering experience, the robotics team visits 
                        Girls Inc and organizes several stations for the girls to experience 
                        and learn about STEM, particularly engineering and computer science. 
                        In the year 2023, there were over 60 girls in the camp, and the robotics 
                        team prepared 9 stations for the duration of two hours. The team plans for
                         this for weeks prior, making sure the activities are enjoyable and realistic. 
                         I, personally, led a station where we controlled LEGO Verni Robots using
                          iPads and drag and drop code. It was amazing to be able to explain the
                           logistics behind the robots in simple terms, and seeing the girls interested 
                           in something I would have loved to experience at their age is a wonderful
                            feeling. At Girls Inc, a majority of the girls are lower income and do not 
                            have the experiences that a lot of the kids on the team had, so it was great 
                            to be able to make that change and get them access to these things.

                    <p class="volPara"> At Rolls Royce STEM Day, the robotics team was brought to the Rolls Royce 
                        Company Building to be able to share our experience with STEM with elementary 
                        schoolers. Rolls Royce offered an elementary school the opportunity to have 
                        a field trip there, and organized an event filled with STEM related activities,
                         as well as a catered lunch. As Rolls Royce is a sponsor of Cyber Blue, not 
                         only was it amazing to share knowledge with kids, but it was amazing to see 
                         the workspace of one of our major sponsors, and see where a lot of people 
                         interested in STEM end up working. Our team brought our big robot, as well as 
                         our minibot and allowed the kids to drive and operate them. Through the process
                          we allowed kids to ask as many questions as they wanted, encouraging them to
                           be curious. I enjoyed this because you could almost see the click in their
                            head as they saw what math and science could turn into in the real world.
                             Being able to provide that connection for them is incredibly empowering, 
                             and I greatly enjoyed this experience.

                    <p class="volPara"> At Abraham Lincoln, I served as a high school volunteer for their robotics teams.
                         As there are so many kids needing guidance on specific ideas and designs for 
                         their robots, it is incredibly important for them to get plentiful guidance as 
                         they learn new mechanisms and design ideas. As it is easy for kids to get
                          discouraged, it was my job to reassure them that testing a design and failing
                           is often common, and something I also have to remind myself of quite often. 
                           It is also my job to teach them new mechanisms, and ensure that they are 
                           following the rules and guidelines of the Vex IQ Robotics Competition they 
                           are designing the robot for. Ensuring that there are enough older people in 
                           the room for the kids to ask for help ensures that they get their projects
                            done within the given time frame. Knowing that I was able to encourage kid’s
                             creative ideas and turn them into a functional robot that they could be
                              proud of is an amazing feeling, and I hope to continue doing this type of 
                              volunteering in the future. </p>

                    <p class="volPara"> At the Vex IQ Competitions, I have been both a Skills Referee, and a Field
                         Referee. I was in charge of keeping score and judging the game based on the
                          preset rules and guidelines. Being in this position allowed me to see so many
                           different designs that the kids and their mentors had come up with, and 
                           seeing so many different yet efficient designs allowed me to further appreciate
                            kids’ creativity and the potential diversity when it comes to my own team’s
                             robots. I volunteered for a total of four competitions, totaling over 40
                              hours. Each of these competitions brought me different experiences, however
                               my favorite opportunity was when the competition was held in Lucas Oil 
                               Stadium. Seeing that programs like these were important enough to be held
                                in a large building like Lucas Oil Stadium further validated my 
                                appreciativeness of these opportunities in my life. </p>

                         Organizing the attendees and planning out food and locations for things takes 
                         time and people. As our team hosts them, it is up to us to do the planning. Team 
                         lists, information folders, and other important things must be done by the team 
                         members before the date. I.R.I is an international off-season competition that
                          hosts teams from all around the world, this is the largest off-season competition
                           in the midwest, and it is incredibly difficult to keep everything organized. Not
                            only do papers need organizing, but two 50 foot fields made of metal must be
                             assembled, and this responsibility falls on the teams. I greatly appreciate
                             being able to have these experiences, as it is a greatly unique one not a lot                              of people get to do. R.A.G.E is an all-girls competition that encourages, 
                          and requires, women to do all of the hard lifting. This allows girls a chance
                           to be the majority in a STEM environment, and encourages socializing and
                            bonding between women in STEM. Our  team hosts this event. All of the field
                             building, and organizing is done by members on our team, and it is 
                             incredibly amazing to know you are encouraging other women to get more
                           involved in their robotics team, something I have been fighting to do 
                               since I joined.

                    <p class="volPara"> Perry Youth Theatre is a program for kids ages 3rd grade to 8th grade. This is
                         a large program that requires high school volunteers to help keep the kids on
                          track. This program is a Theater program with a goal of directing and completing
                           a show within a set amount of time. As a high school volunteer, I watched over 
                           a group of kids and ensured they were safe, and paying attention. Oftentimes
                            the high school volunteers would sing and dance alongside them to lead by 
                            example. Being able to walk alongside kids as they engaged in activities that
                             they genuinely enjoyed, and watching them step out of their comfort zone 
                             and genuinely enjoy it was amazing, as I also was a kid in this program for
                              several years before I became a volunteer. </p>
