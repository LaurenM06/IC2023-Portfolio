                            PMHS’s robotics team, Cyber Blue, is a FIRST Robotics Competition
                             based team. Each year each member must submit a resume and interview 
                             to get a position on the team. Each year FIRST releases a game 
                             each team must design and build a 125 lb robot to compete against
                              other schools with, as well as report on the outreach and volunteering
                               the team has done through the year. This club is an incredible 
                               opportunity to meet other people interested in STEM, and network 
                               with many other people in the community. This opens up many
                                volunteering opportunities. This past year I was a FIRST dean’s 
                                list semi-finalist, meaning I was nominated by my team to interview 
                                at a district competition. This team has been an amazing opportunity 
                                for me, it has helped me build skills I will use in future careers, 
                                and meet people I will be able to reach out to in the future as well.

                            Math League is a club at my school that allows students to
                             meet together and take a short math related quiz each month. 
                             Each month you take this quiz, and statistics are provided to
                              you about your results compared to others in the club. This 
                              past year I finished top five in my school in comparison to
                               others in the club. This allows for playful competition between 
                               people with similar interests as me. Also, as the quizzes are 
                               difficult, it gives a safe space to fail, and a good environment
                                to teach me to pick myself up and try again.

                            Through my years of high school, I have been involved in many shows. 
                            I have been the Stage Manager for over four shows in my high school. 
                            The responsibilities included in the role are high. As a Stage Manager
                             I must attend all rehearsals as well as stay after some days to ensure 
                             the smooth sailing of the show. I must communicate with cast members
                              and tech crew to ensure that the running of the show is organized
                               and everyone feels ready for show night. As stage manager, it is 
                               my responsibility to ensure everyone is on track, while also completing
                                my work, such as completing cue sheets, and overseeing set design.
                                 This is the highest role someone can be when it comes to tech crew,
                                  and while the responsibilities are high, so is the enjoyment.

                               members, but it provides various activities to get the members in the 
                               club to bond. During Women’s Day, 2023, women in the club passed
                                out flowers to our favorite female teachers to show we appreciate their
                                 impact on our lives. During Women’s History Month, we created several
                                  encouraging posters and notes and hung them up in all of our school’s 
                                  women’s bathrooms. I enjoy being in this club for the community and

                                to interact with before. My favorite activity I have done for Key Club
                                 was to volunteer to watch children at a local church to allow local
                                  parents to have a break. There were several activities and knowing I

                              books, but it gave me an outlet to talk about them out loud, making
                               them much more enjoyable. Being able to socialize with people with
